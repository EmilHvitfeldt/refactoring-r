# Preface {-}

Many resources on code smells and refactoring are focusing on object-oriented design (OOD), 
which means that many "ordinary" code smells won't appear in most R code.
I have for the sake of brevity removed code smells that is very unlikely to occur in general R writing.
Shortcuts and keybindings will be shown for the [RStudio IDE](https://rstudio.com/).

TODO specify the difference between
- function
- variable
- parameter
- temp
- Primitive/Atomic

This resource stands on the shoulder of giants.
